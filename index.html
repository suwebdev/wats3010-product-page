                        <p class="text-muted">Pure rose oil has been used for centuries for its beautifying properties. One of its most important properties is that is helps skin stay younger for longer. Thanks to the unique combination of antioxidants like citronellol and geraniol, the pure rose oil helps diminish signs of aging and slows down the free radical damage that causes aging. That makes it beneficial for dry, mature and sensitive skin. It enhances natural skin glow and radiance and helps with superficial broken capillaries and scars, as well as eczema.</p>

                                        <p class="text-muted">We grow and harvest roses and lavender, and distill premium organic rose and lavender essential oils and flower waters using generations-old recipes. We also offer a wide range of organic plant extracts, oils and herbs from the eco-regions of the Balkan Mountain. After many years of extensive research, we enhanced our proprietary steam-distillation method that marries 400 years of tradition with science, to extract flower essences that are dermatology-grade and retain the therapeutic properties and synergy of the plants.</p>
